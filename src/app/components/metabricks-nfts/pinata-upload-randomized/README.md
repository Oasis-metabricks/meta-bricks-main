# 🎲 MetaBricks Randomized Upload Folder

## 📋 Purpose
This folder contains all 432 MetaBrick JSON files numbered 1-432 in randomized order for Pinata upload.

## 🎭 Mystery Strategy
- **File Names**: 1.json, 2.json, 3.json... 432.json
- **Brick Types**: Randomly distributed to maintain user excitement
- **Rarity**: Users won't know brick rarity until minting

## 📁 Contents
- **1.json to 432.json**: MetaBrick metadata files
- **upload-mapping.json**: Original file to upload number mapping
- **upload-summary.json**: Distribution summary and statistics

## 🚀 Pinata Upload
1. Upload this entire folder to Pinata
2. Use the resulting IPFS hash for your MetaBricks wall
3. Users will mint bricks 1-432 in sequence
4. Rarity remains a mystery until reveal!

## 🔍 Verification
Check upload-mapping.json to see which brick type corresponds to each number.
